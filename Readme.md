# Flask Photo Gallery Web Server

This is a simple Flask web server that serves a photo gallery with multiple pages. It uses Flask-Caching to cache the rendered templates to determine whether performance is improved.
The server is hosted on Render (see website link in description).
## Installation
1. Clone the repository in your preferred directory:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/srudraDev/flaskserver.git
    cd flask_server
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    flask run
    ```
    Server is now running on http://localhost:5000

## Report

See the [Web Server Report](WebServerReport.pdf) for full details and analysis on the performance of the Flask web server with and without caching.
